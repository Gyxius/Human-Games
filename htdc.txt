Example: Designing a Character Class (HTDC Approach)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Definition (Define the Concept)
	‚Ä¢	We want a Character that has:
	‚Ä¢	A name (string)
	‚Ä¢	A color (string)
	‚Ä¢	An x and y position (number)
	‚Ä¢	A sprite (Sprite object)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Class Signature & Purpose
	‚Ä¢	Signature: class Character
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: Represents a game character that can be drawn on a canvas.

// Character.js
// A Character represents a player or NPC in the game.

class Character {
  // Signature: new Character(name: string, color: string, x: number, y: number, sprite: Sprite) -> Character
  // Purpose: Creates a new character with a given name, color, position, and sprite.
}

3Ô∏è‚É£ Constructor Definition
	‚Ä¢	The constructor initializes the name, color, position, and sprite.

class Character {
  constructor(name, color, x, y, sprite) {
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
    this.xPosition = x;
    this.yPosition = y;
    this.sprite = sprite;
  }
}

4Ô∏è‚É£ Method Stubs (Skeleton of Class Behavior)
	‚Ä¢	draw(ctx) ‚Üí Draws the character using the sprite.
	‚Ä¢	move(dx, dy) ‚Üí Moves the character.

class Character {
  constructor(name, color, x, y, sprite) {
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
    this.xPosition = x;
    this.yPosition = y;
    this.sprite = sprite;
  }

  // Signature: draw(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D) -> void
  // Purpose: Draws the character using the sprite.
  draw(ctx) {
    // To be implemented
  }

  // Signature: move(dx: number, dy: number) -> void
  // Purpose: Moves the character by dx and dy.
  move(dx, dy) {
    // To be implemented
  }
}

5Ô∏è‚É£ Examples & Tests (Before Full Implementation)
	‚Ä¢	Before implementing, define expected behavior.

// Example usage:
const sprite = new Sprite();
const hero = new Character("Hero", "red", 100, 150, sprite);

// hero should be positioned at (100, 150)
console.log(hero.xPosition); // Expected: 100
console.log(hero.yPosition); // Expected: 150

// After moving:
hero.move(10, -20);
console.log(hero.xPosition); // Expected: 110
console.log(hero.yPosition); // Expected: 130

6Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation (Final Code)
	‚Ä¢	Implement draw using the sprite‚Äôs method.
	‚Ä¢	Implement move to update position.

class Character {
  constructor(name, color, x, y, sprite) {
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
    this.xPosition = x;
    this.yPosition = y;
    this.sprite = sprite;
  }

  draw(ctx) {
    this.sprite.drawCircle(ctx, this.xPosition, this.yPosition, this.color);
  }

  move(dx, dy) {
    this.xPosition += dx;
    this.yPosition += dy;
  }
}

Final Thoughts
	‚Ä¢	This HTDC method helps ensure a clear, step-by-step approach to designing classes.
	‚Ä¢	It focuses on defining behavior before implementing it.
	‚Ä¢	Following this process makes classes more modular, testable, and maintainable.
